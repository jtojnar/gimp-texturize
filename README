GIMP Plug-In Texturize
=====================

This plugin takes a small image and creates a texture out of it.
The idea is to put several copies (patches) of the small image on the big
canvas. The copies aren't complete: we cut the border so that the transition is
invisible, and the the texture seems natural.


If you're under Debian or Ubuntu, before compiling, execute this command:
  sudo apt-get install gimp libgimp2.0-dev intltool
Under a different OS, install
- gimp (you probably already have it...)
- libgimp2.0-dev (libraries for developping with gimp)
- intltool (an internationalization tool).

Now to build and install it, just run:

	./configure
	make
	make install

Then (close and) reopen the Gimp. Texturize will be in the "map" menu.



This plugin is based on the article "Graphcut Textures: Image and Video Synthesis Using
Graph Cuts" by Vivek Kwatra, Arno Schödl, Irfan Essa, Greg Turk and Aaron
Bobick, available from www.cc.gatech.edu/cpl/projects/graphcuttextures.
